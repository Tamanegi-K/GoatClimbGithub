= = = Bouquet Assembly Criteria = = =

Which flowers you use in your bouquet will give it certain qualities called Tags, which come into play when fufilling a villager's request. To fufill a request, walk up to the Requestee and click the Left Mouse Button to see what kind of bouquet they are looking for.

There are six colours of flowers:
 - Red
 - Orange
 - Yellow
 - Green
 - Blue
 - Purple

When assembling your bouquet, you can put up to SEVEN flowers into the bouquet:
 - The first flower you put in is called the Centrepiece
 - The six flowers adorning the sides are called the Accents

A bouquet is best with a Colour Harmony, which are determined by the colours of the six flowers adorned as the Accents:
 - Contrasting, made with accents consisting of two colours opposite from each other on the colour wheel, such as Yellow/Purple and Red/Green
 - Analogous, made with accents consisting of three adjacent colours, such as Blue/Purple/Red and Red/Orange/Yellow
 - Triadic, made with accents consisting of one colour with two more evenly spaced colours, like Red/Yellow/Blue and Orange/Green/Purple
 - Solid, made with accents consisting of only one colour
 - Multicoloured, where every accent flower is a different colour

There exist other special tags that have yet to be implemented, such as Radiant (using a Rare flower as a centrepiece) and Monospecies (use only one type of flower in the entire bouquet).
